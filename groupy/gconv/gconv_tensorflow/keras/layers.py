class SplitGConv2D(tf_layers.SplitGConv2D, tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    """Group convolution base class for split plane groups.

    A plane group (aka wallpaper group) is a group of distance-preserving transformations that includes two independent
    discrete translations.

    A group is called split (or symmorphic) if every element in this group can be written as the composition of an
    element from the "stabilizer of the origin" and a translation. The stabilizer of the origin consists of those
    transformations in the group that leave the origin fixed. For example, the stabilizer in the rotation-translation
    group p4 is the set of rotations around the origin, which is (isomorphic to) the group C4.

    Most plane groups are split, but some include glide-reflection generators; such groups are not split.
    For split groups G, the G-conv can be split into a "filter transform" and "translational convolution" part.

    Different subclasses of this class implement the filter transform for various groups, while this class implements
    the common functionality.

    This layer creates a convolution kernel that is convolved
    (actually cross-correlated) with the layer input to produce a tensor of
    outputs. If `use_bias` is True, a bias vector is created and added to the outputs.
    Finally, if `activation` is not `None`, it is applied to the outputs as well.

    When using this layer as the first layer in a model, provide the keyword argument `input_shape`
    (tuple of integers, does not include the sample axis), e.g. `input_shape=(128, 128, 3)` for
    128x128 RGB pictures in `data_format="channels_last"`.
    Arguments:
      filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
      kernel_size: An integer specifying the width and height of the 2D convolution window.
      strides: An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers,
          specifying the strides of the convolution along the width and height.
          Can be a single integer to specify the same value for
          all spatial dimensions.
          Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying
          any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
      padding: one of `"valid"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive).
      data_format: A string,
          one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`.
          The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs.
          `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape
          `(batch, height, width, channels)` while `channels_first`
          corresponds to inputs with shape
          `(batch, channels, height, width)`.
          It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your
          Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`.
          If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".
      activation: Activation function to use.
          If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
          (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.

      activation: Activation function to use.
          If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied
          (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).
      use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
      kernel_initializer: Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix.
      bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector.
      kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix.
